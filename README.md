# About
* Efficiently analyze sentiments in entity-level text using small Bert (part of the BERT family) created by Google. 
* This project employs advanced natural language processing techniques to predict sentiment behind entities mentioned in textual data.

# Key Features
* Entity-Level Analysis: Focus on sentiments associated with specific entities within the text.
* BERT Pre-Trained model: Pre-trained small Bert for this project.

# Tech Stack
* Python.
* Tensorflow.
* Pandas.
* Kaggle.
* BERT.

# Results
* Achieved an accuracy score of 83.68% on testing datasets.

# Important
* Uncomment lines that have "!pip install" in them.
* Make sure you have GPUs or TPUs on your machine before training the model.
* If you dont have any, you can use either Colabs or Kaggle to have access to GPUs or TPUs.
